# Background-Color-Changer-IOS
This Repo contains a simple iOS app that can change the color of the app's background (to red) and a message below a switch. When the switch is enabled, the message will change; when disabled, it will change back.

This was created for purposes of learning, so do not expect a lot out of this.
